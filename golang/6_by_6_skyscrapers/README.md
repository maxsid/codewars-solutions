------------------
In a grid of 6 by 6 squares you want to place a skyscraper in each square with only some clues:

- The height of the skyscrapers is between 1 and 6
- No two skyscrapers in a row or column may have the same number of floors
- A clue is the number of skyscrapers that you can see in a row or column from the outside
- Higher skyscrapers block the view of lower skyscrapers located behind them

Can you write a program that can solve each 6 by 6 puzzle?
