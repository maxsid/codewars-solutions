--------------------
*Classic definition: A spiral is a curve which emanates from a central point, getting progressively farther away as it revolves around the point.*

Your objective is to complete a function `createSpiral(N)` 
that receives an integer `N` and returns an `NxN`
 two-dimensional array with numbers `1` through `NxN` 
 represented as a clockwise spiral.
